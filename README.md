# Flower Classifier
My capstone project for the Udacity PyTorch Challenge was to create a flower classifier using transfer learning.

## Dataset: Oxford Flower Dataset
http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html
102 classes of flowers common to the UK. Statistics for the dataset classes and their distribution can be found here, http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html
