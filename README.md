# Flower Classifier
My capstone project for the Udacity PyTorch Challenge was to create a flower classifier using transfer learning. Given a user input of an image of a flower, the flower type was predicted. The model was trained on the following dataset.

### Data: Oxford Flower Dataset
[Oxford flower dataset](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/index.html)
102 classes of flowers common to the UK. Statistics for the dataset classes and their distribution can be found [here](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/categories.html).
